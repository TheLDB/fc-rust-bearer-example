# fc-rust-bearer-example

As detailed in the [Merkle API v2 Documentation](https://farcasterxyz.notion.site/Merkle-API-v2-0edc8911f011433182be024d02a17b07), clients that wish to make authenticated calls, need to generate bearer authentication tokens, to grant them a session authentication token.

In this project, is a simple example of how to use ethers-rs, base64, hex, tokio, cjson, and a couple others, to generate that token.
